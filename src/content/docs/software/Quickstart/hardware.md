| Control Board | Responsible for thruster commands, motor mixing, stabilization, and IMU/depth sensor data. | `auv_control_board` library |
| IMU | Provides orientation, acceleration, and gyroscope data. | `auv_control_board` library |
| Depth Sensor | Provides barometric depth data (altitude) | `auv_control_board` library |
| Stereolabs ZED X Mini | Image data (RGB), depth data (pointcloud), pose, and object detection. |  |
| Bottom Camera | Downward-facing image data (RGB), path detection |  |
